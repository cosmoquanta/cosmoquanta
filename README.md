About this website: This website introduces a quantized elastic spacetime model, providing a definition of time based on the time-entropy mapping and demonstrating the mass-gravity duality mediated by the gauge symmetries of the Standard Model in quantum field theory.

This paper addresses two fundamental questions - what time is, and how mass generates gravity - through a quantized elastic spacetime model.

This theoretical framework proposes a discrete quantum-elastic spacetime model that unifies entropy-driven time dynamics with fundamental interactions, bridging quantum field theory and general relativity. The core innovations include:

Time as Entropy-Driven Transformation. Time emerges from irreversible state transitions of discrete spacetime quanta (Space Elementary Quanta, SEQ), where each transition step corresponds to a computable multiplicative entropy derived from spatial transformation matrices. This provides a rigorous definition of time rooted in quantum thermodynamics.

Mass-Gravity Mechanism. Matter arises from SU(3)-mediated compression of SEQ networks, storing energy as mass while stretching surrounding space to generate gravity. The Higgs field acts as a quantum stabilizer to maintain coherence in compressed regions, explaining both quark confinement and gravitational effects.

A key prediction: Chiral asymmetry in electron-positron magnetic moments due to their coupling to the fixed-chirality spin SEQ ground state—a testable signature of spacetime's discrete structure.

The model resolves black hole singularities by imposing an upper limit on SEQ tension and offers analytic foundations for quantum thermodynamics at Planck scales. Gravitational time dilation is explained as reduced SEQ transition frequencies near massive objects.

Invitation for Collaboration： This framework invites interdisciplinary scrutiny and experimental validation. The full paper details derivations, phenomenological consistency checks, and implications for unifying quantum mechanics with gravity.
